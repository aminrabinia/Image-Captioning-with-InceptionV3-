# Image-Captioning-with-InceptionV3-

Image captioning integrates two subtasks of objection detection and text generation for creating captions for the input images. Image captioning models usually entail a feature extraction model and a RNN model for sequence generation. This project uses a baseline model [1] for image captioning and improves this model with a better feature extraction model ([InceptionV3](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/inception-v3-advanced)) and some RNN modifications (with GloVe embedding [2]).
